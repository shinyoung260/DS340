# DS340
This is the implementation platform for DS340 Group 13 (Daniel Miller & Shinyoung Kim) in the fall semester of 2024.
## Instructions to run the code
  1. Download the Implementation.ipynb file
  2. Download the cox-violent-parsed.csv file in the data folder
  3. Go to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
  4. Open the ipynb implementation file by going to file > upload notebook > select the implementation file
  5. Upload the data by clicking on files within the colab implementation file > upload to session storage > select the data csv file
  6. Run the code chuncks to view our implementation (this can be done either individually or through the Runtime > "Run All" function in the menu)
## Notes about reviewing the implementation
The initial filtering and EDA was previously created in the original notebook file, we left the majority to provide context to the problem if wanted. The implementation created by us is included in the final section of the notebook, titled "Machine Learning Implementation." This includes balancing the previously filtered data, applying feature blindness, creating train/test splits, creating the decision tree models, and comparing the results. Note that you will have to run all of the code chunks in the notebook to run the implementation, so using the Run All function is preferred.
